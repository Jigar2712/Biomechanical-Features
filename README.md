# Biomechanical Features
Data analysis has already made its way into many industries. By implementing data analytics in healthcare, this large and complex sector can now tap into its potential and not only has it saved lives, but also money. Big Data has changed the way we manage, analyze and leverage data in any industry. One of the most promising areas where big data can be applied to make a change is healthcare. Healthcare analytics have the potential to reduce costs of treatment, predict outbreaks of epidemics, avoid preventable diseases and improve the quality of life in general (Lebied, 2017).
Here, I have classified the condition of orthopedic patient based on 6 biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine. This will help doctors to treat patients accordingly to their conditions without going into long process of diagnosing the type of condition.

DATASET:
The original data set was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning repository: Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.
Data set consists of 6 biomechanical predictor variables derived from the shape and orientation of pelvis (The large bony structure near the base of the spine to which the hind limbs or legs are attached in humans and many other vertebrates) and lumbar spine (the lower back, where the spine curves inward toward the abdomen).
•	Pelvic incidence: Angle between the line perpendicular to the sacral plate at its midpoint and the line connecting this point to the femoral heads axis. (Numeric data type)
•	Pelvic tilt: It is when the front of the pelvis drops and the back of the pelvis rises. (Numeric data type)
•	Lumbar lordosis angle: A curving inward of the lower back. (Numeric data type)
•	Sacral slope: Angle between the sacral plate and a horizontal line. (Numeric data type)
•	Pelvic radius: (Numeric data type)
•	Grade of spondylolisthesis: Spondylolisthesis can be described according to its degree of severity. (Numerical data type)
On the basis of this 6 biomechanical predictor variables I have trained my model to classify patients as belonging to one out of 3 categories:
Normal, Disk Hernia (A condition which refers to a problem with rubbery disk between the spinal bones) or Spondylolisthesis (A spinal disorder in which a bone (vertebra) slips forward onto the bone below it).
